            <p class="intro">Horror is a genre of fiction or film that is designed to scare, unsettle, or shock its
                audience. Horror
                often involves elements of supernatural, violent, and macabre events, as well as suspense, tension, and
                anxiety. The goal of horror is to elicit strong emotions such as fear, terror, and dread in the
                audience, often through the use of disturbing images, suspenseful music, and frightening characters or
                scenarios. Horror can take many forms, from traditional ghost stories and monster movies to
                psychological thrillers and apocalyptic dramas.</p>

                    Chris and his girlfriend Rose go upstate to visit her parents for the weekend. At first, Chris reads
                    the family's overly accommodating behavior as nervous attempts to deal with their daughter's
                    interracial relationship, but as the weekend progresses, a series of increasingly disturbing
                    discoveries lead him to a truth that he never could have imagined.—Anonymous

            <p class="suspense-intro">Suspenseful films are movies that generate a feeling of uncertainty or tension in
                the audience by using various techniques such as dramatic music, unexpected twists, and visual effects.
                These films are designed to keep the audience on the edge of their seat, wondering what will happen
                next, and increase the level of excitement and anxiety throughout the movie.</p>

                    In 1954, up-and-coming U.S. marshal Teddy Daniels is assigned to investigate the disappearance of a
                    patient from Boston's Shutter Island Ashecliffe Hospital. He's been pushing for an assignment on the
                    island for personal reasons, but before long he thinks he's been brought there as part of a twisted
                    plot by hospital doctors whose radical treatments range from unethical to illegal to downright
                    sinister. Teddy's shrewd investigating skills soon provide a promising lead, but the hospital
                    refuses him access to records he suspects would break the case wide open. As a hurricane cuts off
                    communication with the mainland, more dangerous criminals "escape" in the confusion, and the
                    puzzling, improbable clues multiply, Teddy begins to doubt everything - his memory, his partner,
                    even his own sanity.—alfiehitchie

                    Walter H. White is a chemistry genius, but works as a chemistry teacher in an Albequerque, New
                    Mexico high school. His life drastically changes when he's diagnosed with stage III terminal lung
                    cancer, and given a short amount of time left to live: a mere matter of months. To ensure his
                    handicapped son and his pregnant wife have a financial future, Walt uses his chemistry background to
                    create and sell the world's finest crystal methamphetamine. To sell his signature "blue meth," he
                    teams up with Jesse Pinkman, a former student of his. The meth makes them very rich very quickly,
                    but it attracts the attention of his DEA brother in law Hank. As Walt and Jesse's status in the drug
                    world escalates, Walt becomes a dangerous criminal and Jesse becomes a hot-headed salesman. Hank is
                    always hot on his tail, and it forces Walt to come up with new ways to cover his tracks.—halo1k,

                    Earth's future has been riddled by disasters, famines, and droughts. There is only one way to ensure
                    mankind's survival: Interstellar travel. A newly discovered wormhole in the far reaches of our solar
                    system allows a team of astronauts to go where no man has gone before, a planet that may have the
                    right environment to sustain human life.—ahmetkozan
